    <h1>UHV Mid 2 Important Questions </h1>
    
    <button class="accordion">1. Differentiating Between Intention and Competence</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Intention</h2>
            <p>Intention represents the purpose behind someone’s actions, reflecting values and motives like a desire to help or support.</p>
            <h2>Competence</h2>
            <p>Competence is the ability and skill to perform tasks effectively, showcasing knowledge and experience.</p>
            <h2>Why Both Are Important</h2>
            <p>Good intention paired with low competence means the person can be trusted but might need training. High competence with poor intention can result in misuse of skills, potentially causing harm.</p>
            <h2>Benefits of Understanding Both</h2>
            <p>Understanding both intention and competence helps in fair judgment of others, encourages meaningful connections with trustworthy individuals, and builds a supportive environment.</p>
